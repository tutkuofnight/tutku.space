In the beginning of my childhood, I was always curious about Software Development. But I didn't know where to start learning. As you know, there is a lot of branch in software industry. I finally enrolled to Technical High School IT & Web Design major. And my first code was ```Console.WriteLine("hello world!")``` just like every developer at the beginning. C# was a good language but it became to game changer in my life when i met with JavaScript.

JavaScript taught me the Open Source and the Web concepts. I built a lot of apps & web clients. Then i started to take freelance jobs from my circle. This helped me to get my first job at the company. I was 18 when i joined a company. I learned the things about the industry and how an application releases in real life. Then time passed and i became a 4+ years experienced developer.

I contributed a lot of projects to release in companies and i am still keep going to develop my projects in my github. Currently in my career, i am working as Freelance Full-Stack Developer and i am working as Frontend Development Instructor at  [Archi's Academy](https://archisacademy.com/en). I am giving lessons there and doing Project Leadership for the students. And helping people to learn Software Development right way.

So this is the sort story about me. Welcome to my space. Also you can find my social media & github accounts below. You can contact with me whenever you want.
